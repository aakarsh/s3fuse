s3fuse
======

s3fuse is a FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) driver for Amazon S3.

- For notes on building and installing s3fuse, see INSTALL.
- For copyright/license information, see COPYING.
- For notes on running s3fuse, keep reading.

Goals
-----

- Thread safety -- concurrent operations should behave according to the 
  "principle of least surprise".
- Compatibility with other S3 applications, including Amazon's web-based S3
  browser.
- Improved upload/download performance (by using multipart transfers).
- Support for extended file attributes.
- Support for consistency checking (using S3's MD5-testing features).

Known Issues
------------

- Reduced-redundancy storage (RRS) is not supported.
- No attempt is made to match MIME types to file extensions.

Running
-------

s3fuse can be launched from the command line:

  s3fuse [options] <mountpoint>

Some (potentially useful) command line options:

  -f                Keeps s3fuse in the foreground (i.e., prevents it from 
                    daemonizing).  Useful when debugging.
  -v                Enable verbose logging to stderr (repeat for added 
                    verbosity).
  -o <fuse-options> Pass additional options, separated by commas.
    options:
      allow_other   Allow other users to access the mounted file system.
      allow_root    Allow root to access the mounted file system.
      config=<file> Use <file> rather than the default configuration file.

This is not intended to be an exhaustive listing of FUSE options.

Alternatively, s3fuse can be launched by mount if an appropriate entry exists
in /etc/fstab:

  s3fuse <mountpount> fuse defaults,noauto,user,allow_other 0 0

"user" allows non-root users to mount the file system.  "noauto" prevents the
file system from being automatically mounted at boot.

Multiple buckets can be mounted simultaneously, provided each has its own
configuration file and a corresponding entry in /etc/fstab:

  s3fuse /media/bucket0 fuse defaults,noauto,user,allow_other,config=/etc/s3fuse.bucket0.conf 0 0
  s3fuse /media/bucket1 fuse defaults,noauto,user,allow_other,config=/etc/s3fuse.bucket1.conf 0 0
