Building s3fuse
===============

From a Distribution Tarball
---------------------------

To build from a distribution tarball (s3fuse-*.tar.gz):

  ./configure
  make
  make install

Working Copies
--------------

To build a working copy in the source directory:

  ./build.sh
  make

build.sh will invoke "autoreconf" to build the configure scripts, then call 
"./configure".

Debian Packages
---------------

To build a Debian package (.deb):

  ./build-deb.sh <output-directory>

RPMs
----

To build an RPM:

  ./build-rpm.sh <rpm-top-level-dir>

The top-level directory should contain directories named RPMS, SRPMS, SOURCES, 
SPECS, and BUILD.

Installing s3fuse
=================

To install (after building a working copy):

  make install

Then edit /etc/s3fuse.conf.  The following keys must be defined:

  - aws_key: This is your AWS Access Key ID.
  - aws_secret: This is your Secret Access Key.
  - bucket_name: This is the name of your S3 bucket.

AWS credentials can be obtained using Amazon's AWS console.  The console can 
also be used to create an S3 bucket.
